developers. Apart from using TrueType fonts and graphics images with 
NiceDrivers, you can also print bar codes and use internal (built- 
in) printer fonts for fastest printout.

OPTIMAL USE OF NICEDRIVERS IS THROUGH PROFESSIONAL LABELING SOFTWARE
--------------------------------------------------------------------

NiceDrivers allow you to print labels from any Windows application 
(MS Word, MS Excel, CorelDraw,...) but the real power of NiceDrivers 
is shown when you print labels from a professional Windows labeling 
software. NiceLabel is such a labeling package and it offers full 
label design control and easy connectivity to any external database 
containing label data. Here are more benefits of using NiceDrivers 
with NiceLabel package:

- Optimal usage of your printer capabilities with all built-in 
  functions (automatic serial numbering and bar code incrementing)
- Printing speed is pushed to the limit with usage of built-in 
  bar codes and optimisation of re-sending only the part of the label 
  that is different from previous one
- WYSIWYG designing and printing power of one of the most 
  technically advanced and user-friendly environments
